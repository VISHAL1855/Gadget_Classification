# Gadget classification using pretrained RESNET-50 and Pytorch deployed using Gradio and Hosted on Huggingface. 
2.Created a Gadget Classification project which classifies the gadgets images as Laptop, Mobile and Headphones.<br />
3.Demo (https://huggingface.co/spaces/ishaal007/gadgets_classifier)<br />
4.Dataset: Own dataset used (Uploaded on Github)<br />
5.Use app.py for gradio deployment <br />
6.model.py is an inference pipeline for the saved model<br />
7.use your pretrained model in app.py <br />
